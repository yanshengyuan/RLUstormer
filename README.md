# RLUstormer
Replacing RLUnet's Uformer architecture with my proposed Ustormer architecture

Another incremental study on RLUNet. I replace RLUNetâ€™s Uformer architecture with the Ustormer architecture proposed in my Master Thesis. The training is successful although the deblurring performance is mediocre. 

Illustrations for the use of this repository:

1, data preparation and training

First download GoPro dataset for training on GoPro's official site and run training command in below:

python3 ./train.py --arch Uformer --gpu '0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7' --train_ps 128 --train_dir ../GoPro/train --val_dir ../GoPro/test --embed_dim 16 --warmup --batch_size 64 --lr_initial 0.002 --nepoch 500

3, test and pretrained models

My originally pretrained weights will not be supplied here. When you have finished your own training, use your .pth files in the test.py scripts
